# Lab-07 - City Explorer


**Version**: 1.2.0 

## **Overview**
An application that takes user input. The input pings the backend server and displays the results on the screen. The end goal is for the user to enter a city name and have the screen display the weather data from DarkSky, Yelp info, local Meetups, Movies with that city in the name, and nearby hikes from the Hiking Project.
